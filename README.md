C# Exercises

Practice of the fundamentals of C# using a pre-fabricated Visual Studio Solution.

In this solution I found a file named Exercises.cs with a list of exercises to be completed, and a set of tests to pass in Program.cs.

The goal of the assignment was to get familiar with C# and working with Visual Studio, and to make all of the specified tests pass.
